## Introduction
<p align="justify">

  Open-Source EDA (Electronic Design Automation)➡️ refers to the movement towards making EDA tools and resources freely available to the public. This democratizes access to advanced design tools, allowing everyone to make use of it 

  OpenLANE➡️ is an automated RTL (Register-Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Database System II) flow2
. It integrates several open-source tools like OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, and custom scripts for design exploration and optimization2
. OpenLANE aims to simplify and automate the physical design process, making it accessible to a broader audience

Sky130 PDK (Process Design Kit)➡️ is an open-source PDK provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry in collaboration with Google and Efabless4
. It is based on SkyWater's 130nm CMOS technology and offers designers worldwide free access to chip design technology to create manufacturable designs4
